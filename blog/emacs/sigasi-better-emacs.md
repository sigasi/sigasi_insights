Over the past few weeks, I have made an effort to demonstrate that Sigasi 2.0 is better than Emacs VHDL mode. I have also argued that Emacs VHDL mode used to be the best VHDL editor on the planet. In summary, I wrote about:

* [why-emacs-vhdl-mode-so-great-and-why-we-want-beat-it],
* [engineers-are-smart-enough-change-editors],
* [emacs-syntax-errors],
* [no-vhdl-rename-emacs-vhdl-mode],
* [no-vhdl-libraries-emacs-vhdl-mode],
* [emacs-code-coloring-outdated],
* [vhdl-emacs-mode-navigation-using-ctags-are-broken],
* [room-improvement],

One of the most common comments I got was that Emacs is free. I know there is a bit of ambiguity in the word [free](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre), but I get the feeling that most people are worried about their money. They don't want to pay for an _editor_. It seems hard for people to compare a $840 tool, with [one](http://www.iis.ee.ethz.ch/~zimmi/emacs/vhdl-mode.html) that comes at a flat $0.00. 

Tomorrow, we will launch the Sigasi 2.0 Starter Edition. The _Starter Edition_ will be free. Not just for a week or for a beta period, but forever.
The Starter Edition is designed to be better than Emacs for any VHDL work you do. If your VHDL design is _small_ enough, you even get access to _all of the nice features_ that paying customers will have. Stay tuned for more info.
