Select VHDL based on its syntactic structure. This allows you to cut, copy and move code a lot faster.

Note that the default shortcut is different on Mac and Windows.
Mac uses **Ctrl-Shift**. Windows and Linux use **Alt-Shift**.

You can modify this in the Keys preference page (**Preferences > General > Keys**) if you want.
The command names are:

* Select Enclosing Element
* Select Next Element
* Select Previous Element
