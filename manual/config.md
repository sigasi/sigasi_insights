# Choosing your VHDL and Verilog version {: #configure-version}

Sigasi supports VHDL version 1993, 2002 and 2008, and Verilog (2005) and SystemVerilog (2012). You can select the default VHDL version to use in: **Window > Preferences > Sigasi > VHDL**. You can set the default Verilog in: **Window > Preferences > Sigasi > Verilog**. 

Since [Sigasi 3.2][/releasenotes/sigasi-3.02], you can also set the language version per project, per folder and per file. In the Project Explorer, right click your project, folder or file; select **Properties**, **VHDL Version** (**Verilog Version** for Verilog projects) and select the version via the dropdown menu.

When you change the language version of a file, only that file is affected. However, when you change the version of a folder, then everything in that folder will have the new language version. Any overrides in the folder and its sub-folders will be removed. When you are defining the language versions for a new project you should map from top (project root) to bottom (files).

The version information is stored in `<project path>/.settings/com.sigasi.hdt.vhdl.version.prefs` and `<project path>/.settings/com.sigasi.hdt.verilog.version.prefs`. We recommend you add this file to version control so you can share it with your team.

**Notes**:

* **VHDL libaries:** Any new project that you create will have the common libraries (`STD` and `IEEE`) that correspond to your selected VHDL version. Your *existing project will **not** be modified*. If you want to update the common libraries for an existing project, right-click the project and select **Library Mapping > Reset Common Libraries**. Since [Sigasi 3.3][/releasenotes/sigasi-3.03], you will get a warning if your common libraries do not match the VHDL version of you VHDL file. You can use the proposed quick fix to resolve the issue.
* If you want to compile VHDL 87 code, you should select the “1993” option. There are no checks to warn about constructs that were not supported in 1987, but that were introduced in 1993.


# Colors and Fonts {: #configure-colors}

You can configure the code coloring by selecting **Window > Preferences > Sigasi > VHDL > Syntax Coloring**. For each class of semantic and syntactic elements, you can select the font, letter color, background color, style (bold, italic, underline, strike through).

## Font size

Sometimes you want extra small fonts, so that you can fit more content on your screen. Another time you
may want extra large fonts, so that you can use a beamer and your audience can see what you are doing.

Most fonts, including the font that is used by the editors, can be controlled in the preferences:
**Window > Preferences**. Fonts are controlled in **General > Appearance >Colors and Fonts**. The font of the editors are in **Basic > Text font**.

Some fonts cannot be controlled in this preference page. These fonts are defined by general system settings, and are used for writing the menu names, the Project Explorer view and the Outline and Hierarchy views. On
Windows, you can change these fonts by changing your font settings in the Windows Control Panel. On Linux, these fonts are controlled by a settings file: `${HOME}/.gtkrc-2.0` . You can change the font by adding
a line like:

`gtk-font-name = "Sans 10"`

You have to restart Sigasi Studio before these changes take effect.

## Annotations Colors

*Annotations* are colors added on top of your text editor, and to the right of your text editor, in the scroll bar. The image below shows annotations for each occurrence of a certain data type. The color has
been changed to bright green.

![Annotations in Bright Green](images/annotations-in-green.png "Annotations in Bright Green")

You can change the color of annotations in **Window > Preferences > General > Editors > Text Editors > Annotations**. For the particular case of *occurrence* annotations, you want to modify the color for
annotation type **Occurrences**. 
If more than one **Occurrences** type is displayed, you need the `org.eclipse.xtext.ui.editor.defaultOccurrenceAnnotation`. The others may refer to occurrences for Java or other plug-ins.

# Tabs and Spaces

If you want to use spaces instead of tabs, you can set your indentation preferences in: **Window > Preferences > General > Editors > Text Editors**. Here you can select choose to **Insert Spaces for Tabs** and choose your preferred **Displayed Tab Width**.

# The “Gutter”

The *Gutter* is the small area to the left of the editor view. It is used for displaying extra information about your code.

-   Line numbers: What line is this?
-   Quick Diff: Did this file change?
-   Folding: hiding pieces of code from view
-   Markers: error markers, warnings and bookmarks.

There is not much to configure about markers, but the other categories can be turned on or off.

## Line numbers

To enable line numbers, right-click in the gutter and select **Show Line Numbers**.

## Quick Diff

Instead of using a compare editor, you can enable **quick diff** support and see the changes within the text editor. This feature can be enabled via **Window > Preferences > General > Editors > Text Editors > Quick Diff**.

When you enable Quick Diff, you can see changes in the active editor with the version on disk (or the latest version in version control), by hovering the annotations in the gutter.

# Linting rules {: #configure-linting}

You can choose the severity of linting rules in: **Window > Preferences > Sigasi > VHDL > Errors/Warnings**.
Read more information about [linting].

# Language

Eclipse is available in several languages, and you can install the language pack of your choice. Read more in this support article : [/tech/installing-translations-eclipse]

# Keyboard shortcuts

Sigasi comes with a large number of [keyshortcuts] preconfigured. You can configure keyboard shortcuts (key bindings) in **Window > Preferences > General > Keys**. You can modify individual keyboard shortcuts or add new key bindings.
There is also a preconfigured scheme for Emacs-like keyboard shortcuts.

After you have configured your keyboard shortcuts, you can export your settings and share them with your colleagues (or re-import them on another computer):
To export, go to **File > Export… > General > Preferences**, and select **Key Preferences**. To import that file: **File > Import… > General > Preferences**.

# Formatting

You can set formatting options in the Formatter preference page:
**Window > Preferences > Sigasi > VHDL > Formatting**

-   **Preserve newlines**: this option configures the formatter to not add or remove newlines in your code
-   **Upper case keywords**: when this option is enabled the formatter will convert all keywords to uppercase. When this option is **not** enabled, uppercase keywords will be converted to lowercase. (Without a [xl] license, keywords are not changed by the formatter).
-   **Alignment column for trailing comments**: this setting configures the column Sigasi uses to align trailing comments (default is column 40)
