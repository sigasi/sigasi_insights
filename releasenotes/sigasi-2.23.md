*The Sigasi 2.23 release introduces basic *datatype checking* at type-time for VHDL; improved *Verilog* support; and much more.*

## Basic datatype checking at type-time for VHDL

Sigasi now reports datatype violations while you type (at type-time). You don't have to wait for your simulator to report datatype errors. Whenever you write a wrong datatype, you see an error message within less than a second! Screencast : [/screencasts/datatype-checks-while-you-type]

## Improved Verilog support

We are accelerating our development of the Verilog version:
* Open Module Declaration by CTRL+clicking on instantiation
* Hover on module name to see the inline documentation

## Other new and noteworthy improvements

* Improved support for *external VHDL files* (i.e. non Sigasi Project VHDL files). We now report all syntax errors.
* Linting *check for read/write access* of port, signal, generic and constant declarations \[Premium\]

* Updated the JAVA Virtual Machine in the stand-alone to version 8. Note that this is not updated with the Sigasi update mechanism; you need a fresh download if you want this improvement.
* Support for <a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/releases/luna">Eclipe Luna</a>
* Added *VHDL Project Import Wizard*

* Better *error reporting in unknown instantiations*: only mark the unknown component name as a *single error*
![Only one error marker in unknown component instantiations](2.23/unknown-instantiation-only-one-error.png "Only one error marker in unknown component instantiations")
* Added *tutorial* project for *Sigasi Premium*
* Added preference page to *configure Task Tags* in comments (TODO, FIXME)
