## Part 1: VHDL files

The goal of the first part is to get comfortable with the Sigasi Studio VHDL editor. By the end you will be able to *easily detect and fix VHDL syntax issues*, *customize editor preferences* and *know the basic keyboard shortcuts*.

### Edit

* Open file `part1_edit.vhd` via **File > Open File...**
* Make the editor *full screen* (Double click on the tab)
* Double click again to exit *full screen* mode
* Format the VHDL code (**Ctrl+Shift+F**, *Make sure that no text is selected*)
* Fix all VHDL syntax issues, use the QuickFix where possible (When in doubt, **Hover** over the error Marker)

* Delete a line with **Ctrl+D**
* Comment a line with **Ctrl+/**
* Move a line up and down with **Alt+Up** and **Alt+Down**
* Autocomplete (**Ctrl+Space**)
  * Name
  * Constant declaration  
  * `if` statement in a `process` (Use **enter** to exit the *template mode*)
  * `if generate` in an `architecture`  
* Block select (**Shift+Alt+A**, or button in toolbar)
  * Delete a Block
  * Add content on multiple lines 
* Enable *Show whitespace* (¶-button) and type some *tabs* and *spaces* to see the difference
* Find & Replace  
	* Experiment with **Ctrl+F**, e.g. find all `TODO`'s
	* Use **Ctrl+K** to find the next occurrence of the current selection
	* Use **Ctrl+J** (and start typing) for an inline, incremental search. *Look at the status bar to see what you have already typed*.
* Use **Quick Access** to convert an identifier to UpperCase (Select the identifier, type `upper` in the Quick Access Field in the Toolbar and confirm with **Enter**)
* Mess up the indentation of a part of the source code, select it and **format only the selection**.

### Navigate

* Open file `part1_navigate.vhd` via **File > Open File...**
* Open Declaration  (**F3**)
* Move back to last location (**Alt+Left**)
* Go to Line  (**Ctrl+L**)
* Navigate to errors with the gutter (Click red rectangles in scroll bar)
* Navigate to next problem marker (**Ctrl+.**)
* Navigate with the *Outline view*

### Customize settings

Preferences can be set via **Window > Preferences**.

* Open file `part1_custom.vhd`
* Switch to VHDL 2008 (**Preferences > Sigasi > VHDL**) and note that the syntax error get resolved
* Tabs or spaces ( Use the search box in the preference dialog and type `tab`) Use *Show whitespace* to check.
* Uppercase keywords (**Preferences > Sigasi > VHDL > Formatting**) (Use *format* to check)

### Optional Extra tasks

* Open file `part1_extra.vhd`
* *Stuttering* (in the editor, double tap the `.`, `;` or `,` key)
* Try *structured select* <http://insights.sigasi.com/manual/editor.html#structured-selection>
* Drag and drop a file from your file explorer in the Editor part of Sigasi Studio
* Create a new file  (**File > New External File**)
* Outline: Figure out what *Link with editor* button (⇆) does
* Add a keyboard shortcut preference for *show whitespace* (Search for the **Keys** preference page)

## Part 2: VHDL projects

The goal of Part 2 is to understand what a project is, why you want projects and how to set one up. You will learn how to add files to your projects and make sure the VHDL library is set up correctly.

As an extra, you will learn how to efficiently work with Finite State Machines.

### Setup

* Switch to the **Sigasi** perspective (Button in top right) 
* Import project `part2_vhdl_project`
  1. **File > Import...**
  2. **Existing project into Workspace**, **Next**
  3. **Browse** to `part2_vhdl_project`
  5. **Finish**
* Close unrelated projects (Right Click on the project in Project Explorer and select **Close Unrelated Projects**)

### Navigation

* Open `navigation.vhd` with **Open Resource** (**Ctrl+Shift+R**) or via the Project Explorer
  * Project Explorer: Enable the *Link with editor* button (⇆)
  * Hover over `MAX_COUNT`
  * Open declaration of `std_logic` and other declarations
  * Navigate back (**Alt+Left**)

* Open `components.vhd`
  * Navigate from the component instantiation to the matching entity: press and hold the **Ctrl** key and hover over the component to see a menu with hyperlinks. Click the link to open it.
  * Find References of port `rst`
  * Open two editors side by side (Drag editor tab)

* Navigate through the project with the following Views: (If they are not visible, open them with **Quick Access**)
  * Libraries View
  * Problems View
  * Task View
  * Dependencies View

### Edit 

* Open file `edit.vhd`
* Use Quickfix to fix the invalid sensitivity list
* Remove trailing whitespace (Use **Quick Access** to find and run this action)

### Libraries

* Open `libraries.vhd`
* Set folder `my_lib` to library `my_lib` (Project explorer: **Set Library**)

### State machines:

* Open file `fsm.vhd`
* Declare enum type `state_type`: (`init`, `running`, `ready`)
* Declare variable `state` of `state_type`
* Autocomplete `case statement`
* Add some transitions
* Add case choice `when idle` and use quickfix to add enum literal to enum type (QuickFix)
* Remove case choice `when idle` and use the quickfix on `case state` to add it again.
* **Ctrl+Hover** on a state assignment and select **Open Matching when Clause**. 

### Rename

* Open file `rename.vhd`
* Manual rename: Change (edit) `port_1` to `port_1a` and manually update the matching instantiations
* Rename (**Refactor > Rename element**) port `port_a` to `port_aa`
* Compare file with *Local history* (Right-click on file, **Compare With > Local History...**) and inspect the changes you made

### Import (non-Sigasi) project + setup libraries

* First: Check that your are in VHDL 2008 mode
* **File > Import...**
* **Sigasi > Import a VHDL project**, **Next \>**
* **Browse...** to `vunit_example`, **Finish**
* Set the project to library `uart_lib` (right click, **Set Library**)  
  Check the library annotations in the project explorer
* Add library `vunit_lib`:
  * Drag and drop the `vunit_lib` folder from you File System Explorer (e.g.: Windows Explorer, Mac Finder, Nautilus) into the `Common Libraries` folder (in the Project explorer). Choose the option to *link to files and folders*.
  * Set the library to `vunit_lib`  
* Set the library for the test files (`uart/src/test`). Read the source code for the library name.
* One more library is not correctly set. Try to fix this. (Tip: the sources are already in the project)

### Optional Extra Tasks

* Select `edit.vhd` and `navigate.vhd` and compare them via the right click menu.
* Configure and enable an External Compiler (See `extra_compiler.vhd`)
* Set the top level and start the Simulator (See `extra_compiler.vhd`)
* Export a CSV file with all files in your project (**File > Export... > Sigasi > CSV file**)

## Part 3: Linting and other features

In Part 3 you will learn about VHDL linting (code checks) and how you can get to zero warnings.

We will also explore other features that are not specific to VHDL.

### Linting

* Import Project `part3`
* Close unrelated projects (Right Click project in Project Explorer)
* Fix all **Errors** (Track your progress in the Problems View)
* Fix all `--TODO: fix` **Warnings** (Track your progress in the Task View). We will get to the other warnings later.
* Change the severity of the **Check for position associations in instantiations** linting via the Preferences (**Sigasi > VHDL > Errors/Warnings**). Set to severity to **Error**. Note that this warning in the code is now an error.

### Waive specific warnings

* Open `waive.vhd`
* Suppress the *Null Range* warning by adding
 ```
 -- @suppress
 ```  
 **Note:** You need to save the file before the warnings disappears.
* Note that the warning marker is removed from the **Problems View**
* Explicitly specify which warning you suppress by adding the warning message prefix:
 ```
 -- @suppress "Null Range"
 ```
* Note that the warning marker re-appears when you type another prefix
* Now also explain why you suppress the warning by adding an explanation:
 ```
 -- @suppress "Null Range" Ok here, see http://...
 ```
 
### Other features

* Project Explorer
  * Show hidden files (Click **▿**, **Customize view**, disable the `.* resources`)
  * Delete a file from your project. Next, restore this file from local history (Right click, **Restore from Local History...**)
* Bookmarks:
  * Right click a line number and select **Add Bookmark**
  * Open the bookmark view (**Window > Show View**)
* Multiple screen support
  1. Open a new Window (**Window > New Window**)
  2. Drag the new windows to a different screen
* Customize Autocomplete templates: Add a custom header to the `entity/architecture pair` template:
  1. **Window > Preferences > Sigasi > VHDL > Templates**
  2. Select **entity/architecture pair**
  3. Click **Edit...**
  4. Add a custom header (e.g. `-- Confidential, Copyright 2016`)
  5. Confirm with **OK**
  6. Create a new VHDL and select your customized template (**File > New > VHDL file**, choose a name, **Next** and choose the `entity/architecture pair` template)

## Part 4: Hierarchy, Graphics and documentation

In Part 4 you will learn how to use the Hierarchy View. You will also learn how to use and export Graphics and Documentation with Sigasi Studio.

### Hierarchy View

* Import project `part4` (and close unrelated projects)
* Open `testbench.vhd`
* Right click the `STR` architecture and select **Set as Top Level**
* Explore the resulting tree in the Hierarchy View:
  * Inspect the value of generics (Notice how the value in `dut_instance` differs from its default value)
  * Change the value of a generic and note how the Hierarchy View refreshes when you save the file.
  * Add a syntax error in a file and note that Sigasi Studio is able to recover and still show valid content in the Hierarchy View.
  * Disable the **Toggle Hierarchy Refresh** toggle button, and note Sigasi Studio no longer auto-updates the hierarchy when edit your files. (This is useful for big hierarchies)

### Block Diagram View

* Open `testbench.vhd`
* Right click the VHDL editor and select **Show in > Block Diagram**
* Double click ports or connections to navigate to the corresponding VHDL code. (This also works the other way around by clicking **Show in > Block Diagram** on ports in the VHDL code)
* Make some changes in the VHDL code and note how the Block Diagram updates when you save your file.
* Select `dut_instance` in the diagram, right click and select **Open Entity Declaration** to navigate to the corresponding entity, `dut`.
* Click the save icon 💾, and export the diagram to a PNG or SVG file.

### State Machine View

* Click **Window > Show View > State Machines** to open the State Machine view
* Open `dut.vhd`
* Double click on a few nodes and transitions in to navigate to the corresponding VHDL code.
* Change the VHDL code of the state machine and notice how the view updates (See the TODO tag)
* Add a comment to the `when idle: state := preparing;` transition. For example: `-- start preparing`  
  Notice how the transition labels update
* Toggle the (Aa)-button to show/hide the transition labels.
* Click the save icon 💾 to export the diagram to file.

### Documentation

* Import project `Sigasi_doc`
* Open the Documentation View
* Open file `testbench.vhd`
* Edit comments and note how the documentation is updated:
  * Document a port (by adding a comment)
  * Document a generic
  * Document an architecture
  * Document an entity
* Export PDF
* Inspect the DocBook file

### Optional Extra tasks

* Try out **Net search** in `stimgen.vhd` (Project `part4`)
* State Machine View: Add a second state machine in `dut.vhd` and note how it is displayed in a new tab.
* Finish the documentation of the Project to get a clean and complete PDF.

<!--
* Modify the documentation templates:
  * Copy the templates from the Installation (`<installation folder>/plugins/com.sigasi.hdt.docgen.resources_.../templates`) to your workspace (`<workspace folder>/sigasi-templates`)
  * Modify the `preview.xml` template and inspect the result in the **Documentation View**
-->

# Troubleshooting

* Where are my views? → **Window > Perspective > Reset perspective**
* Unexpected error markers? → **Project > Clean...**
* Error markers are not updated? → Make sure **Automatic build** is enabled
* More on <http://insights.sigasi.com/manual/trouble.html>
