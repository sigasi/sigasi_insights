People <a href="http://www.google.be/search?q=hate+vhdl">hate VHDL</a>. People <a href="http://www.google.be/search?q=love+vhdl">love VHDL</a>. But most of all people love to complain about VHDL. 
I want to make a list of reasons to love or hate VHDL. Not to complain about them and not to prove that VHDL is better or worse than Verilog. No, I want to make this list so that we can use the strengths of VHDL, and find ways to overcome its weaknesses.

For all the Verilog guys reading this: I know Verilog deserves the same analysis. Since we do not have a Verilog product available today, I will save this discussion for later. In the meanwhile, please give me a reason to put Verilog at the top of our priority list.

## I Love VHDL Because

* VHDL allows me to write a hardware design at a <strong>high level of abstraction</strong>.
* VHDL is <strong>strongly typed</strong> so a large class of errors get flagged at compile time.
* VHDL allows me to <strong>create new datatypes</strong>, so that I can write concise code.
* VHDL has good mechanisms for <strong>code reuse</strong>, such as datatypes, functions, procedures and packages.

## I Hate VHDL Because

* The VHDL <strong>syntax is not consistent</strong>, and hard to remember.
* The VHDL syntax is very <strong>verbose</strong>: you have to type a lot of words to get something done.
* VHDL is pedantic in its requirements for <strong>type casting and conversions</strong>.
* VHDL does not define a <strong>file and directory structure</strong>; everybody uses their own file structure.

I have several more items for each list, but I am more interested in your reasons for loving and hating VHDL. 
Please let me know!
