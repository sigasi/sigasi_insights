Sigasi Starter Edition is free to use. In exchange for this, we ask that you enable [Talkback](/manual/common/talkback) and that you keep your software up to date.
Any version that is more than 6 months old will stop working. We do this to ensure that everybody gets the latest features, and keep people from running 
in to any issues that have already been fixed.

This information only applies to Sigasi Studio <b>Starter</b> edition and <b>Educational</b> licenses.<br/>
If you have a commercial license, you can keep using older versions.
