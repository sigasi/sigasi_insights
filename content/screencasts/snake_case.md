Sigasi Studio has a lot of very useful [keyboard shortcuts]({{< ref "/manual/keyshortcuts.md" >}}) that make dealing with Verilog, VHDL and SystemVerilog a very smooth experience.

In Sigasi Studio 4.9 the Sigasi development team made a few tweaks to the “Next word” and “Previous word” shortcuts. It now has special support for Snake_case identifiers.
