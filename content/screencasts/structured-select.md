Select VHDL based on its syntactic structure. This allows you to cut, copy and move code a lot faster.
On Windows and Linux, use **Alt+Shift**.

Note that on MacOS (supported up to [Sigasi Studio 4.17](/faq/#macos)), the default shortcut is **Ctrl+Shift**.

You can modify this in the Keys preference page (**Preferences > General > Keys**) if you want.
The command names are:

* Select Enclosing Element
* Select Next Element
* Select Previous Element
