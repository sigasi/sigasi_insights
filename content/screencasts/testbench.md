Writing a testbench skeleton is easy with Sigasi's autocomplete feature. Just keep pressing **Ctrl-Space**.
There are powerful autocomplete templates for:

* VHDL entity / architecture skeleton
* VHDL component declaration
* VHDL instantiations of component or entity
* signal declarations
* [and much more](/manual/user_interface.html#auto-complete-and-content-assist)
