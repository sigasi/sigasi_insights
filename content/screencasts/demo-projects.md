Once you’ve finished the basic tutorials in Sigasi Studio, it’s time to start on your own projects. However, before doing so it might still be useful to have a look at some real-world sample projects. This video shows how you can import additional demo projects in Sigasi Studio from our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sigasi/sigasi_demos).
