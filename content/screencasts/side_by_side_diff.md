You can use Sigasi to compare your files to an older version. This older version can be stored in a revision control system (such as Subversion, CVS, Git or Clearcase) or it can be in your <em>local history</em>. This local history is especially interesting because you don't have to do anything to activate it. Sigasi takes snapshots of your files as you are working!
