Sigasi Studio 3.8 brings support for **Markdown in Comments** and for **Multiline trailing comments**.
We also improved the **Documentation Generation** and the **Dependencies View**.
Read below to find more new and noteworthy changes.

# Documentation and hover improvements

## Markdown markup in comments

VHDL and SystemVerilog comments are now processed with a [Markdown processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). This allows to add markup (e.g. bold, code, paragraphs, hyperlinks,...) to comments. This results in nicer hovers and documentation.

[![MarkDown in comments](3.8/markdown_comments.png "markdown comments")](3.8/markdown_comments.png)

In hovers the complete Markdown syntax is supported. For PDF documentation generation following features are supported:

* paragraphs (add and empty comment line to break paragraphs)
* line breaks (by adding two trailing spaces)
* *emphasis* (`*emphasis*`)
* **strong** (`**strong**`)
* lists
* tables
* external links and email addresses (`<http://www.sigasi.com>`, `[Sigasi](http://www.sigasi.com)` and `<sales@sigasi.com>`)


## Multiline trailing comments

Sigasi Studio has a few simple rules to [associate comments with HDL declarations][/manual/documentation#Comment Association]. In version 3.8 we have refined and extended the association rules to support multiple single line trailing comments.

[![Multiline trailing comments](3.8/comment_association_multiple_trailing.png "Multiline trailing comments")](3.8/comment_association_multiple_trailing.png)

*Empty lines* between comments now break the comment blocks. This provides a convenient way to *un-associate* comments from declarations. You can add an *empty **comment** line* to combine comments with multiple paragraphs.

[![Unassociated comments](3.8/comment_association_unassociated_comment.png "Unassociated comments")](3.8/comment_association_unassociated_comment.png)

We have also updated the **Formatter** and **[Structural select][/screencasts/structured-select]** to respect (and fix) comments according to the new association rules.

[![Comments formatter](3.8/comment_association_formatter.png "Comments formatter")](3.8/comment_association_formatter.png)

Note that the comment association rules are identical for both (System)Verilog and VHDL.

## PDF documentation update

We also did significant improvements to the documentation export:

* **Support for (System)Verilog modules**: The documentation now also documents (System)Verilog modules.
* **Top Level only export**: In the export wizard you can now select either a **Project** or just a **top level**. Selecting a **top level** will only add the documentation of design units that are part of the selected hierarchy.
[![Top level only export](3.8/export_doc_toplevel.png "Export documentation for a top level")](3.8/export_doc_toplevel.png)
* **State machines**: If architectures contain state machines, these will be included in the documentation
[![State machines in documentation](3.8/statemachine_doc_pdf.png "State machines in documentation")](3.8/statemachine_doc_pdf.png)
* **Result folder**: The generated `DocBook` and `PDF` files are now written in the `sigasi-doc` folder (and no longer in the root of your project).
* **Diagram paths**: Diagrams are now generated in `sigasi-doc/blockdiagrams` and `sigasi-doc/statemachines`.
* **Duplicate design units**: If your project contains duplicate design units, documentation export is not possible. We now show a clear dialog instead of a cryptic message in the console view.

# Dependencies Viewer (Mixed language)

The *Dependencies Viewer* can now also show the libraries in which files are built and it can show the
design units within the files.
Use the new icons to enable or disable the features of the Dependencies Viewer:

* ![](3.8/icon_project.png) Show all files in project
* ![](3.8/icon_libraries.png) Show libraries
* ![](3.8/icon_units.png) Show design units

# Other new and noteworthy improvements

* We implemented the last missing VHDL 2008 features in Sigasi Studio: functions with generic parameters
* Quickfix for c-style equals  
[![C-style equals quick fix](3.8/c_style_equals_quickfix.png "C-style equals quick fix")](3.8/c_style_equals_quickfix.png)
* Improved autocomplete priorities (`records > conversion functions`)
* Allow (System)Verilog Preprocessor settings dialog to globally include files
[![Allow `includes` on preprocessor page](3.8/includes_sv.png)](3.8/includes_sv.png)
* Updated Eclipse in standalone version to Eclipse 4.7.2
* Added VHDL autocomplete template for `function` prototypes (useful in packages)
[![Function prototype autocomplete template](3.8/function_prototype_autocomplete.png)](3.8/function_prototype_autocomplete.png)
* Add parameter to `procedure body` autocomplete template
* \[XL] Added extra linting check for file header comments: check that header comment matches a pattern
[![Check header comments](3.8/header_comment.png "Check header comments")](3.8/header_comment.png)
* \[XL] Added extra linting check for file names: check that the primary unit names in the file are part of the file name. Note that this check is **ignored** by default. You can enable it in the VHDL **Errors/Warnings** preference page (**Style Validation > Filename must contain primary name**)
