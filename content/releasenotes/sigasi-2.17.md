The Sigasi 2.17 release brings support for generic packages (VHDL-2008),
autocomplete for type conversions and other new and noteworthy
improvements and fixes.

Generic Packages \[VHDL 2008]
----------------------------

Sigasi 2.17 supports generic packages. Both *generic constants* and
*generic packages* are supported as generic items. Generic Types are not
supported yet.\
This will allow you to use the standard **Fixed Point** (`fixed_pkg`)
and **Floating Point** `float_pkg` packages from the IEEE library.

Autocompletions for type conversions
------------------------------------

In VHDL design you need to do a lot of type conversions (Think:
std\_logic\_vector ~~\> signed~~\> integer -\> …). Sigasi’s autocomplete
functionality can now help you to type these conversions faster and more
accurate. Put a dot (`.`) after the element you want to convert, and the
autocomplete suggestions will appear. The conversion functions have
descriptions like “convert type” and “convert to …”.

Do not forget to add a use clause for the `numeric_std` package first.

Library Mapping File is now mandatory
-------------------------------------

Sigasi store the library mapping information for each project in the
`.library_mapping.xml` file in the root of your project. Before the 2.17
release, Sigasi loaded the default mapping (`work`) if this file was not
available. Starting with release 2.17, Sigasi assumes all files are
**not mapped** if the library mapping file is missing. In this case,
Sigasi will also add one error marker to the project with the message:
“This VHDL project can not be built since the library mapping
information is missing”.

To add a default .library\_mapping.xml file to your project, you can
right-click your project and select **Library Mapping \> Reset Library
Mapping**.
