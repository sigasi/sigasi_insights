With the Sigasi Studio 4.16 release, we proudly present the following noteworthy changes.

* [**VHDL 2019 tool directives**](#vhdl-2019-tool-directives)
* [**Signed Windows binaries**](#signed-windows-binaries) for better interaction with Windows SmartScreen
* A [**new and improved regex engine**](#new-and-improved-regex-engine)

As always, there are many other improvements that enhance speed and usability to offer you a better experience, read on to discover them all.

This release we're deprecating the [Graphics Configuration]({{< ref "manual/graphics.md" >}}).
We'll introduce a **new and improved solution** in a following release.
If this feature is vital to you **[please let us know](https://www.sigasi.com/support/)**.  

# VHDL 2019 tool directives

VHDL 2019 improves many aspects of the popular hardware design language.
One of the novel features it brings is tool directives - a simplified version of the preprocessor found in SystemVerilog or the C family of languages.

Tool directives allow to conditionally enable code based on tool type, debug mode, or really any other custom variable.
This release adds full support for these new VHDL 2019 directives to Sigasi Studio.

You can edit the defined tool directives by right-clicking your project and then going to `Properties > VHDL Conditional Variables`.

Check out [the video]({{< ref "/screencasts/vhdl_2019_conditional_analysis.md" >}}) to see directives in action.

# Signed Windows binaries

Starting with the Sigasi 4.16 release, our installation files are signed and notarized for Windows, Mac and the Java virtual machine.  
Windows SmartScreen, Mac OS, and malware detection software will no longer raise an alarm when Sigasi Studio is launched for the first time because all the binaries are now published with irrefutable proof that no malicious third party tempered with the original installation files.

{{< figure src="/img/releasenotes/4.16/SignedWindowsBinaries.png" link="/img/releasenotes/4.16/SignedWindowsBinaries.png" title="Sigasi Studio now has signed Windows binaries">}}

# New and improved regex engine

Regular expressions are used in many parts of Sigasi Studio. The most visible feature using it is the [Naming Conventions]({{< ref "manual/rules/naming-conventions.md" >}}), where you can fill in their own expressions to be used in validations.
Next to writing syntax errors however, a regex can easily incur a large, exponential performance hit.
A small change to a regex can cause a high amount of backtracking, skyrocketing its execution time.

We carefully evaluated different options to mitigate potential performance problems that are caused by some shapes of regular expressions. Sigasi Studio 4.16 now ships with [RE2/J](https://github.com/google/re2j) which scales nicely for large inputs and even complex naming conventions.

Do note that an extra warning directing you to the naming conventions will be shown if a regex is used that is supported by the Java regex engine, but not by RE2/J.

# Deprecated Graphics Configuration

Sigasi can automatically generate a [Block Diagram]({{< ref "manual/views.md#block-diagram-view" >}}) and a [State Machine]({{< ref "manual/views.md#state-machine-view" >}}) from your code. However, these autogenerated diagrams might become quite complicated and hide the essence of the design. Sometimes you also just want to create custom visualizations or simplifications.

For this reason, Sigasi features a custom DSL (called the [Graphics Configuration]({{< ref "manual/graphics.md" >}})) that allows you to filter, color, highlight, group,... parts of your design in these diagrams. However, a custom DSL, even with good a good editor, is quite a cumbersome solution to this issue.

Sigasi has deprecated this cumbersome solution and will present a more user-friendly approach in a future release. If you feel like this feature is vital to you **[please let us know](https://www.sigasi.com/support/)**.

# New and Noteworthy Changes

* Sigasi on linux now shows Chromium dependencies in an error dialog at startup. Mac and Windows have no need for such a dialog as they always have all the necessary dependencies available
* All remaining mentions of the Creator license have been removed
* The automatic autocomplete after typing `.` or `` ` `` can now be disabled in `Preferences > VHDL` or `Preferences > Verilog/SystemVerilog`  
  {{< figure src="/img/releasenotes/4.16/AutocompleteAfterDot.png" link="/img/releasenotes/4.16/AutocompleteAfterDot.png" title="Toggle automatic autocomplete after character">}}
* Formatting has been enabled for files that use keywords of a higher language version
* We've made it easier to **Ctrl + hover** over very short identifiers
* Improved resilience to changes in the project for the [Find References View]({{< ref "manual/editor.md#find-references" >}})
* Improved responsiveness for the Find References View
* Removed the <span uk-icon="question"></span> button from views in which they were redundant
* Removed outdated documentation from Eclipse's internal documentation pages
* Navigating from the [Outline View]({{< ref "manual/views.md#outline-view" >}}) or the [Hierarchy View]({{< ref "manual/views.md#hierarchy-view" >}}) to the editor now selects more relevant constructs
* A warning is now issued on the `.library_mapping.xml` when it references non-existent files. A Quick Fix to remove the offending mapping has been also been added.
* Errors reported by external toolchains that do not contain a location are now propagated to Sigasi Studio as errors on the project  
  {{< figure src="/img/releasenotes/4.16/LocationlessErrors.png" link="/img/releasenotes/4.16/LocationlessErrors.png" title="Toolchain's errors without location are linked to project">}}
* The [Documentation View]({{< ref "manual/views.md#documentation-view" >}}) now reacts better to all kinds of changes to the project, assuring it never misses a refresh
* `Show In > Dependencies` tries harder to select the right element, preventing disturbing **beep** sounds
* Colors changed through `Preferences > Sigasi > VHDL or Verilog/SystemVerilog > Syntax Coloring` are now immediately applied
* The [State Machine View]({{< ref "manual/views.md#state-machine-view" >}}) icon to show edge labels (![show labels icon](/img/releasenotes/4.16/font.png)) has been replaced by an icon to hide comments (![hide comments icon](/img/releasenotes/4.16/hide_comments.png)) and an icon to hide the conditions (![hide conditions icon](/img/releasenotes/4.16/hide_conditions.png)). The [Graphics Configuration]({{< ref "manual/graphics.md" >}}) now also offers the ability to show only comments or conditions separately through `labels comment` or `labels condition`.
* All of our tree views (Hierarchy View, [Open Design Unit]({{< ref "manual/editor.md#open-design-unit" >}}), Export diagrams, ...) now use consistent capitalization and coloring
* It's now possible to select the project for which to configure VUnit in the [Add VUnit support]({{< ref "manual/vunit.md#add-vunit-support-to-an-existing-sigasi-project" >}}) dialog
  {{< figure src="/img/releasenotes/4.16/AddVUnitSupport.png" link="/img/releasenotes/4.16/AddVUnitSupport.png" title="Add VUnit Support wizard with project selection">}}  
* Improved cleanup of OS resources in autocompletes
* We've reformatted our license files to improve readability, the actual content was **not** changed
* We've made our tutorials more consistent, making sure they use correct wording, hotkeys and directions towards other screens
* **[VHDL]** Attributes now have an icon and are marked as attributes in the autocomplete pop-up window
* **[VHDL]** `open` in ranges is now taken into account for validations
* **[VHDL]** `configuration`s are now included in the [exported documentation]({{< ref "manual/documentation.md" >}})  
  {{< figure src="/img/releasenotes/4.16/ConfigurationInDocumentation.png" link="/img/releasenotes/4.16/ConfigurationInDocumentation.png" title="Configurations are now included in documentation">}}

* **[Verilog]** Added support for assignment patterns in initial blocks

```verilog
initial begin
    '{c} = s;
end
```

* **[Verilog]** Removed `localparameter`s from the `Parameters` table in exported documentation as these are not externally modifiable
* **[Verilog]** Added linking support for `let` declarations in `clocking` blocks
* **[Verilog]** Using invalid constructs - such as `modules` or `interfaces` - in `packages` will now generate an error
* **[Verilog]** Pressing `enter` at the end of many constructs (`package`, `class`, `interface`, ...) will now trigger [Smart Indent]({{< ref "manual/editor.md#smart-indentation-1" >}}) to unindent the ending line
* **[Verilog]** Stuttering has been removed from Verilog as it's only useful for VHDL
* **[Verilog]** Improved highlighting of the `Invalid package item` validation
* **[Verilog]** Xilinx encrypted files (starting with `Xlx`) are now ignored by the Verilog engine
* **[Verilog]** The Hierarchy View now shows the labels of `generate` blocks
* **[Verilog]** Added new validations for
  * infinitely nested preprocessing directives  
    {{< figure src="/img/releasenotes/4.16/NestedExpansion.png" link="/img/releasenotes/4.16/NestedExpansion.png" title="Validation of infinitely nested expansions">}}
  * allowed locations of preprocessor directives
    {{< figure src="/img/releasenotes/4.16/PreprocessorDirectiveLocationValidation.png" link="/img/releasenotes/4.16/PreprocessorDirectiveLocationValidation.png" title="Validation of allowed locations for preprocessor directives">}}  
  * spaces between the backtick and the preprocess directive's name  
    {{< figure src="/img/releasenotes/4.16/SpaceInPreprocessorDirective.png" link="/img/releasenotes/4.16/SpaceInPreprocessorDirective.png" title="Space after backtick of preprocessing directive">}}

# Updates

* Eclipse has been updated to 2022-03
