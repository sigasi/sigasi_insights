Sigasi Studio 3.7 brings type-time **component/entity mismatch checking** with associated **Quick Fix**,
**SystemVerilog improvements**, **GHDL** support and many more new features and bug fixes.

# Check for component/entity mismatch + Quick Fix

Sigasi Studio now warns you if a `component` declaration and its matching `entity` get out of sync.
This is a common annoyance in HDL design that is typically discovered late in the design flow.
Sigasi Studio now reports mismatches immediately, at **type time**.

You can easily update a component declaration to match its entity declaration by applying the Quick Fix.

# SystemVerilog improvements

We significantly improved and optimized the way Sigasi Studio analyzes **include files**.
We also reduced the *memory footprint* and improved the project *analysis time*.
Because now all includer/included-relationships are tracked project-wide,
Sigasi Studio can provide very accurate navigation **without any extra configuration effort** on your part.
This allows you to focus on the code instead of having to track which parts of your design are in scope.

For example, to add **UVM** support to your project, you now only have to:

1. Drag and drop the source folder in your project
2. Add the UVM source folder to your project's include path

Next, Sigasi Studio figures out all relations automatically, allowing you to easily follow declarations, use autocomplete and preview preprocessor macro expansions.
For more information, you should read the updated [UVM example post][/tech/systemverilog-uvm-demo].

# Dependencies Viewer (Mixed language)

The *Dependencies Viewer* can now display the dependencies of your entire project.
This makes it very easy to recognize *top levels* and *orphaned files*.

# GHDL support (VHDL)

Especially for our educational users using Apple MacBooks, we added support for the open-source GHDL simulator.

![GHDL support](3.7/ghdl_support.png)

Make sure to [download the latest version of ghdl from GitHub](https://github.com/tgingold/ghdl/releases).
Do not download the outdated version that [http://ghdl.free.fr](http://ghdl.free.fr) links to.

# Autocomplete performance (Mixed language)

We did a thorough performance analysis of the SystemVerilog and VHDL autocomplete feature.
This way we could vastly reduce the autocomplete latency, especially for larger projects.

# Other new and noteworthy improvements

* Because some of our users did not realize Sigasi Studio is more powerful when you use it on projects, we made some UI changes to clarify this. When an external file is opened, we now show a warning bar at the top of editor to clearly indicate you are missing out on a lot of features  
  ![editing an external file](3.7/external_file_banner.png)
* Add "Export CSV file with dependencies" feature available as action in the hierarchy view  
  ![export csv in hierarchy view](3.7/csv_hierarchy.png)
* You can now open the **Dependencies View** via the "Show in" menu in the editor  
  ![show in dependencies](3.7/show_in_dependencies.png)
* The Riviera-Pro toolchain now has `-dbg` as default option
* \[VHDL] Allow to simulate a `configuration` as toplevel
* \[VHDL] Improved constant evaluation in hovers  
  ![constant evaluation in hover](3.7/constant_evaluation_hover.png)
* \[VHDL] Renaming of procedure arguments in package or package body now correctly renames arguments everywhere  
  ![rename procedure](3.7/rename_procedure_parameter.png)
* \[VHDL] Support VHDL 2008 tool directives (`)  
  ![VHDL 2008 tool directives](3.7/vhdl2008_tool_directive.png)
* \[VHDL] Add autocomplete template for formatter tags  
  ![formatter tags autocomplete](3.7/formatter_tags.png)
* \[VHDL] The Quick Fix for the **Vivado Unisim** library now uses the real Vivado library, and not the legacy ISE compatibility version
* \[Graphics configuration] You can now also reference labeled assignments
* The **Sigasi Starter** perspective is no longer the default perspective
* The **FlexNet** floating license key checkout now **times out faster**
* We updated the Eclipse Xtext dependency to `2.13.0`

# How to update?

If you have Sigasi Studio 3 installed, you can [update][/manual/setup#Software Updates] or [download a fresh install of the latest version][download_latest].

# Sigasi 3.7.1 point release

On January 8th we released Sigasi Studio 3.7.1. This release fixes following reported issues:

* Fixed refresh when editing Graphics Configuration files
* Fixed error in Dependencies View when using project dependencies.
* Allow to use multiple arguments on the Vivado XSim preference page
* Solved plugin dependency issue in older (pre Oxygen) Eclipse versions
* Fixed showing constant values in hover

Thanks for all bug reports and enabling Talkback.
