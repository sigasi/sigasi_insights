The Sigasi 2.18 release brings further improvements to the external
compiler integration and other improvements and bug fixes.

External Compiler improvements
------------------------------

As discussed in a recent blog post, [/opinion/call-feedback-new-way-compile-sigasieclipse-project-dependencies-external-compiler],
we have improved the compilation of **project dependencies** with an
external compiler. This significantly improves the external
**compilation time** and improves the accuracy of **incremental
(external) compiles**.

If you are using Mentor’s `vsim` in Sigasi, the simulation is now
started with your **project’s folder** as **working directory**. This
makes it a lot easier to save and load `vsim` scripts.

We also worked on the stability of external compilation of **Verilog
files**. Thanks for all the feedback and bug reports.

New license preference page
---------------------------

The license preference page is now more intuitive. Your license key is
now stored but always store it in a real file, and in preference page,
you can easily change the file location (or floating license server
path). You can also edit the contents of your license file via the
**Edit License File** button.

Clicking **Apply** or **OK** will trigger a reload of your license.

Your current license settings will be automatically updated.

Other new and noteworthy improvements
-------------------------------------

-   We now have a **sort button** to the **Generics View**, so that
    generics and constants are sorted alphabetically. This makes it
    easier to find your generic (or constant) in a long list. If you
    don’t sort the generics and constants alphabetically, they are
    listed in the order of declaration of the file.

-   Show the label of entity instantiations in the ouline view (ticket
    2713)
