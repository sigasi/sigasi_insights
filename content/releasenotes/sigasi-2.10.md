Sigasi 2.10 brings a new **State Machine navigation** feature, **automatic hierarchy refresh**, **avoiding full rebuilds** and more.

State Machine Navigation
------------------------

We introduce a new, power navigation feature for **finite state machines** (FSMs) in VHDL.
If you press **Ctrl** and **click** on the **name of a state**. You jump directly to the relevant *when* part of your *case statement*. There is
a screencast, [/screencasts/navigation], to show how it works.

Automatic Hierarchy Refresh
---------------------------

The hierarchy view now automatically refreshes itself when you save your
design files. You can turn the automatic refresh on and off by toggling
the refresh button.

Avoiding full rebuilds
----------------------

We have added extra intelligence to avoid full rebuilds. In two
important cases, the older versions of Sigasi triggered unnecessary full
rebuilds: (1) while the user is mapping VHDL [/manual/libraries] or (2) if other EDA tools write and
delete binary files in the project directory. The new version makes an
extra effort to avoid full rebuilds, saving you time.

Other New and Noteworthy Improvements
-------------------------------------

-   Start `vsim` with `modelsim.ini` as parameter when it exits in the
    root folder of the project.
-   Code folding for blocks (ticket 2332)).
-   Avoid unnecessary *clean builds* when closing external files.
-   If the `vcom` compiler takes too long, you can terminate the `vcom`
    process by pressing the stop icon in the progress view.
-   Better CSV export when a project depends on other projects (ticket 2284)).

Bugfixes
--------

-   ticket 2323 : Fully qualified names in component instantiations

    spaces instead of `%20` in the search view
-   ticket 2335 : Error when triggering quick-fix if certain uses
    clauses are used.

-   ticket 2344 : Store the toggle state of the instantiations filter in
    the hierarchy view when Sigasi is restarted.
