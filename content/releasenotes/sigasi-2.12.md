Sigasi 2.12 brings a **Libraries View** to Sigasi and external
compiler/simulator support for **Xilinx ISE Simulator (ISim)**.

Libraries View
--------------

Sigasi now contains a **Libraries View**. In the Libraries view you can
see a tree of all *projects, libraries and design units*. The Libraries
View enables you to quickly see how your *design units* are mapped.

The easiest way to enable the Libraries View is via **Window &gt; Reset
Perspective…** You can find the view in a tab behind the project
explorer.

ISE Simulator (ISim)
--------------------

We added support for Xilinx ISim as external compiler/simulator for
Sigasi. So in addition to the existing `vcom/vsim` support, you can now
select ISim to compile your projects and start simulations.

Note that we changed the preference pages to configure your preferred
external compiler. We merged the **External compilers** preference page
with the **Toolchains** page, so that all external toolchain settings
can be configured on the same page. The Isim path is automatically
derived from the Xilinx ISE preference.
