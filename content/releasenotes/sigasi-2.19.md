The Sigasi 2.19 release brings a quickfix for common common **missing
use clauses**, further improvements to the **external compiler**
integration and other improvements and bug fixes.

Quickfix to add common missing use clauses
------------------------------------------

in Sigasi 2.19 you can now use a quickfix to automatically add the
missing **library** and **use clause** for IEEE packages to your VHDL
design unit.

Configure external compiler/simulator settings in the Sigasi preference pages
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

We refactored the Sigasi preference pages to configure the external
compiler integration. You can now easily switch between different
compilers. We also added the option to add extra command line arguments.

-   Verilog `INCLUDE` directives now hyperlink to the referred include
    file

-   We have updated the bundled Java Runtime Environment to Java 7
    Update 45. Note that this update is only bundled in the stand-alone
    download, it will not update through the Sigasi update mechanism.

-   In the VHDL perspective, you can now easily navigate to a different
    via the **Show In** menu in the context menu.
