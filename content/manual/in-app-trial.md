You can request a 7-day trial license from within Sigasi Studio for Eclipse and VS Code and quickly start working on your HDL project.

### Sigasi Studio for VS Code

When you install the extension from the VS Code extension [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Sigasi.sigasi-vscode) and open your HDL project, you will see a small pop-up window on your bottom right with a button that says `Request trial`.

{{< figure src="/img/vscode/trial/request-trial1.png" link="/img/vscode/trial/request-trial1.png" width="823" class="uk-align-center" >}}

After clicking it, a trial request form will appear. Note that the MAC address will be pre-filled, but you should make sure to select the correct one for your machine.

When the form is completed, press `Submit` and you are good to go. If the process is successful, an email will be sent to the provided address to confirm your identity and your license file will be sent to you via a second mail with instructions on how to install it.

Note that if you missed the original pop-up, you can get to the trial form by clicking `here` in **Sigasi > Path To License** setting.
