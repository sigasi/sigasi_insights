As you become more experienced with Sigasi Studio, you will find that there are a number of actions that you perform quite often. At some point, you may feel that the GUI-based approach becomes too slow for these actions. For that reason, Sigasi Studio provides a number of keyboard shortcuts. They are a great way to boost your productivity. A printable cheat sheet with [all shortcuts on one page is available for download](/resources/keyboard-shortcuts.pdf).

In this chapter, we describe the available keyboard shortcuts.

# Top keyboard shortcuts

In this section, we list the most important shortcuts.

1. *Open Resource* (**Shift+Ctrl+R**):  
   **Shift+Ctrl+R** opens a dialog that allows you to swiftly open an editor on any file in the workspace.
1. *Open Declaration* (**F3**):  
   Use **F3** to navigate to the declaration of the selected identifier.
1. *Open Design Unit* (**Shift+Ctrl+D**):  
   **Shift+Ctrl+D** opens a dialog in which you can type a name or pattern to open a specific VHDL or SystemVerilog design unit name.
1. Backward History (**Alt+Left**):  
   Often, when you navigate to a declaration you want to go back to where you came from; just press **Alt+Left**.
1. Content Assist (**Ctrl+Space**):  
   With content assist (autocomplete) you can really speed up coding VHDL. Just press **Ctrl+Space** to get a suggestion of possible autocompletes in the current context.
1. Go to next marker (**Ctrl+.**)  
    Does your file contain warnings or errors? Quickly navigate to the next problem by pressing **Ctrl+.** (**Ctrl+,** jumps to the previous problem).
1. Quick Fix (**Ctrl+1**):  
   To fix problems even quicker, navigate to the problem with the previous shortcut. Press **Ctrl+1** to activate the Quick Fix, select the fix with the **UP** or **DOWN** keys and execute the Quick Fix with **Enter**.
1. Go to Line (**Ctrl+L**)  
   You can directly jump to a certain line with this shortcut. You can display the line numbers by right-clicking on on the gray bar on the left side of the editor view and clicking on **Show Line Numbers**.
1. Search references (**Shift+Ctrl+G**)  
   To search for all occurrences of a given identifier, just select the identifier and press **Shift+Ctrl+G**. The search view is displayed, with a match for each occurrence (possibly in multiple files)
1. Rename Refactoring (**Shift+Alt+R**)  
   Once you get used to the rename refactoring you will be using it all the time. Use **Shift+Alt+R** to run it even quicker.
1. Toggle Block Selection (**Shift+Alt+A**)  
   Switch between regular and block selection mode.
1. Structured Select (**Shift+Alt+Up/Down/Left/Right**)  
  Select VHDL or Verilog code, based on its *syntactic structure*. ([Structured selection](/manual/editor#structured-selection))  
1. Format (**Shift+Ctrl+F**)  
  Format your current VHDL or SystemVerilog file.  
1. <a name="quick-access"></a>Quick Access (**Ctrl+3**, <mark>This is the shortcut to use, when you forgot the shortcut you actually need.</mark>)  
  With Quick Access you can quickly find open editors, available perspectives, views, preferences, wizards, commands, etc. Simply start typing the name of the item you wish to invoke.

# Mac users

If you are using Mac OS X, most of these keyboard shortcuts use Command instead of Ctrl. To inspect the exact list of keyboard shortcuts, go to **Preferences > General > Keys**.

# Customizing keyboard shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts can be easily customized via **Preferences > General > Keys**.

This preference page also enables you to select the **Emacs** scheme, for more Emacs-like keyboard shortcuts, or (if you have installed the [UltraEdit key bindings for Eclipse](/tech/ultraedit-key-bindings-eclipse) plugin) the UltraEdit key bindings.
