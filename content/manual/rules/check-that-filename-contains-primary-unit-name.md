title: Filename Contains Primary Unit Name
---

Sigasi Studio can check that the filename contains the name of at least one of the design unit names inside that file.  Note that this check is **ignored** by default. You can enable it in the VHDL **Errors/Warnings** preference page (**Style Validation > Filename must contain primary name**).
