## Stuttering

Stuttering is an editing technique popularized by Emacs, that lets you
type certain things really fast. You activate it by tapping a certain
key twice which will expand it to something more complex. For example, press
the period key **.** twice, and the editor will expand it to a right
arrow `=>`. Stuttering works like double-clicking: if you type keys
**slowly**, the stuttering mechanism will not be triggered.

The following stuttering keys are available:

| Keys      | Effect       |
| --------- | ------------ |
| **,,**    | `<=`         |
| **..**    | `=>`         |
| **;;**    | `:=`         |

This feature can be configured in [VS Code]({{< ref "/manual/vscode/editor.md#stuttering" >}}) and [Eclipse]({{< ref "/manual/eclipse/editor.md#stuttering" >}}).
