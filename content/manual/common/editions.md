# Editions

## Sigasi Studio Starter

Sigasi Studio Starter is the best free VHDL, Verilog, and SystemVerilog editor that works on **single files** only and _not_ with projects.

Sigasi Studio Starter works without a license key but requires [Talkback](/manual/common/talkback), and you need to keep your version up to date.
