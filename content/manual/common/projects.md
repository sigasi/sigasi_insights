Below you can find all the available project variables that are implicitly defined.

- For {{< pill text="VS Code" >}}: `PROJECT_LOC`
- For {{< pill text="Eclipse" >}}: `PROJECT_LOC`,  `ECLIPSE_HOME`, `WORKSPACE_LOC`, and `PARENT_LOC`

Both platforms also support `PARENT-<COUNT>-<VARIABLE>` to refer to folders relatively `COUNT` above the `VARIABLE` folder
