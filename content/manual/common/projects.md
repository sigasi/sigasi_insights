list of all that are defined automatically

For VS Code: PROJECT_LOC
For Eclipse: PROJECT_LOC,  ECLIPSE_HOME, WORKSPACE_LOC, PARENT_LOC

Not entirely sure if the Eclipse ones are defined automatically though but it's in the code base :spicy_cowboy_eyes: 

Of course for both we also support PARENT-<COUNT>-<VARIABLE>
