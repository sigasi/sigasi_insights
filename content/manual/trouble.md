# The user interface is unresponsive

If the user interface of Sigasi Studio is unresponsive, you can interrupt the internal compilation process by pressing the **stop** button in the progress view. To activate the progress view, select **Window > Show View > Other... > General > Progress**, or click the tiny conveyor belt icon ![](/img/icons/progressicon.png), on the right side of the status bar.

# The editor displays old contents of a file

If you edit a file outside of Sigasi Studio with an external editor, Sigasi Studio will normally notice the changes and ask if you want to load the changes. If
it doesn’t, you can refresh the editor’s content by pressing **F5** or by right-clicking a file or a project in the project explorer and
selecting **Refresh**.

# No content in the editor and only a cross in the editor tab

If you see **empty views** in Sigasi Studio on Linux: make sure `libXss` or `libXscrnSaver` is installed.

# How much local history will be stored?

Sigasi Studio stores the history of your file so that you can compare your current version with the version you saved an hour ago.

You can define how much disk space is used for storing local history in **Windows > Preferences**, select **General > Workspace > Local History**.

For more information on local history, check out [this page](http://help.eclipse.org/help32/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/gettingStarted/qs-55.htm).

# I see hundreds or thousands of errors

If you see a large number of errors, you either have very, very buggy code (not so likely) or your project is not configured correctly.

1. Check that all files are mapped to the correct library.
2. Check that all *stale* files are ignored. (see the section on [unneeded files](#sigasi-studio-analyzes-hdl-files-that-i-do-not-need))
3. Check that all third party libraries are included.
4. Make sure that automatic build is enabled.

# Auto Build is not Enabled

Symptoms:

* When you introduce an error in a VHDL or Verilog file and save the file, an error marker shows up in the file, but not in the problems view.
* Navigation (Find References, Open Declaration) behaves strangely when it involves more than one file.
* Other features that involve multiple files behave incorrectly: autcomplete, refactoring, ...

Cause: Project is not built automatically

Resolution: Enable automatic project builds: **Project > Build Automatically**

# Project does not have VHDL support

Symptoms:

* VHDL files contain errors, but these errors do not show up in the Problems View.
* Cannot select a top level in the Hierarchy View
* Cannot navigate from a name in one file to its declaration in another file.
* In the Project Explorer, the name of the library (for example: `[work]`) is not shown next to the filename.

Cause: The project does not have VHDL support enabled

Resolution: Enable VHDL support: **right-click the project > Configure > Add VHDL support**

# Project does not have Library Mapping Information

Symptoms:

* All VHDL-files in the project are **not mapped**
* The Project contains only one error: “This VHDL project can not be built since the library mapping information is missing”
* VHDL files contain errors, but these errors do not show up in the Problems View.
* In the Project Explorer, the name of the library (for example: `[work]`) is not shown next to the filename.

Cause: The project does not have a (valid) VHDL library mapping information file

Resolution: Reset the library mapping: **right-click the project > Library Mapping > Reset Library Mapping**

# Project does not have Common Libraries

Symptoms:

* Project has many errors, in practically all files. Project build may be slow.
* The standard data types (like `integer` and `std_logic`) are not recognized.
* The IEEE and STD libraries are not recognized.
* The IEEE and STD files are either missing or are mapped to the wrong library (for example: `[work]`).

Cause: Common libraries are not configured correctly.

Resolution: Reset the common libraries: **right-click the project > Library Mapping > Reset Library Mapping**

# Sigasi Studio analyzes HDL files that I do not need

By default, Sigasi Studio assumes that all VHDL or Verilog files are part of the project. However, some projects may contain multiple files with older or alternative definitions of a VHDL object. We call these *stale* files, because they are no longer used. In such a case you will want Sigasi Studio to ignore certain files.

To exclude files (or directories) from analysis, consult the [Libraries manual page](/manual/libraries).

Ignored resources are decorated with a ![](/img/icons/ignoreicon.png) icon in the project explorer view.

# Sigasi Studio startup fails: "Could not create the Java virtual machine"

On some computers, the standalone version of Sigasi Studio will fail to start with an error message similar to: "Could not create the Java virtual machine." This happens especially on 32-bit Windows machines with less than 2GB of physical memory. The reason is that the Java virtual machine tries to allocate more memory than what is available.

In order to solve this, you can decrease the default heap size settings. You can do this by adding following lines to `sigasi.ini` or `eclipse.ini` in your Sigasi Studio installation folder:

```bash
-vmargs
-Xmx1000m
```

This sets the maximum heap size to 1000 MB (instead of the standard 3GB).

**Note:** Do not use `eclipsec.exe`, as this will ignore all of the settings configured in the eclipse.ini file.

# Sigasi Studio shows a startup message about port 4444 already being in use

If you want to run Sigasi Studio on a server with multiple users, the configuration files should be updated according to the descriptions [here](/manual/opening#run-sigasi-studio-with-multiple-users-on-the-same-server).

# I want a clean restart

If you ever suspect that the state of your project is inconsistent in Sigasi Studio, you can do one or all of the following things. Consider these
steps to be advanced usage; you should not need them during normal operation.

## Force a clean compilation

You can force a completely clean compilation by selecting: **Project > Clean … > Clean All Projects > OK**.

## Remove stale markers

Sometimes markers remain visible, even after the problem is fixed or when a file is excluded from compilation. We call these *stale markers* and they are can be caused by a crash during compilation.

You can delete these stale markers from the Problems View: In the Problems View, select the markers and press **DEL** (or right-click and select **Delete**).

Note that during the next build, the tool may generate new markers. If you want to suppress certain warnings, you can [configure the linting rules](/manual/config#linting-rules).

## Remove the workspace state

Much of your configuration and cached data is stored in your workspace. By default, Sigasi Studio’s workspace is located in `${HOME}/workspaceSigasi`.
A lot of this data is stored in the hidden `.metadata` directory. Sometimes, a part of your metadata can become corrupt. It can help to
remove the `.metadata` directory (take a backup first!). This clears all of your workspace state.

* You will need to enter your license code again.
* You will need to import your projects again. **Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace**

# Keep getting reports about an "Incompatible version of Quartus II"

If you are using the integration with Altera Quartus II. Some people keep getting a dialog box that says:

> Incompatible version of Quartus II
>  
> Project interface was created with an older, incompatible version of Quartus II.
> Is it OK to upgrade the project to match the installed version of Quartus II?

Obviously, you should upgrade the project. If this message keeps popping up, you may want to check that Sigasi Studio is using the correct version of Quartus II, in the Sigasi Studio application: **Window > Preferences > Sigasi > Toolchains > Altera Quartus II**.
