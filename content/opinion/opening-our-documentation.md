As of today, all of our user documentation will be freely available on <a href="/manual/">our website</a>. We realize that this is not conventional for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_design_automation" class="elf-external elf-icon">EDA</a> software. A few months ago, John Ford noted that some companies make it <a href="http://jab-semi.blogspot.com/2008/11/password-arms-race.html">unnecessarily hard</a> to access their documentation or knowledge bases. We think that there is a better way.

You know that we have a culture of open communication with our customers. We allow anybody to download and <a href="http://www.sigasi.com/start">try our software</a>. We talk to you on the phone, through email and on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/sigasi">twitter</a>.

The user manual and other documentation has been packaged with Sigasi HDT from the start, but now we open it up on the web. This will make it easier for everybody to access and search the documentation. As always, we welcome your input, so that together we can build the future of VHDL design.
