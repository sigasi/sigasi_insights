**Since the summer of 2019 the Sigasi Insights pages are using the Hugo static site generator.**

The [Sigasi Insights](/) pages were previously generated [using Urubu](/opinion/urubu).
Earlier in 2019 we moved our [main website](https://www.sigasi.com) from WordPress to a static site generator.
For this we decided to use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with a new theme built on [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/).

Now we are bringing the same technology used for our main website to our Insights pages.
This will allow us to be more efficient in updating both sites.
At the same time it still is possible to [self-host](/tech/local_hosting) and to [contribute](/tech/contribute-to-insights) to our documentation.

Expect some new content soon!
