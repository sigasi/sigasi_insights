They force a workflow on the user, limit the number EDA tools that work with their IDE, and provide half-baked usability. The only way to fix this is to stop using IDEs that are built by EDA (electronic design automation) companies. Electronic design engineers should start learning and copying from their colleagues in software engineering.
