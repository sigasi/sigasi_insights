Over the past few weeks, I have made an effort to demonstrate that Sigasi 2.0 is better than Emacs VHDL mode. I have also argued that Emacs VHDL mode used to be the best VHDL editor on the planet. In summary, I wrote about:

* [Why Emacs VHDL mode is so Great. And Why We Want to Beat it]({{< ref "why-emacs-vhdl-mode-so-great-and-why-we-want-beat-it" >}})
* [Engineers are smart enough to change editors]({{< ref "engineers-are-smart-enough-change-editors" >}})
* [Emacs Syntax errors]({{< ref "emacs-syntax-errors" >}})
* [No VHDL Rename in Emacs VHDL mode]({{< ref "no-vhdl-rename-emacs-vhdl-mode" >}})
* [No VHDL Libraries in Emacs VHDL mode]({{< ref "no-vhdl-libraries-emacs-vhdl-mode" >}})
* [Emacs Code Coloring is Outdated]({{< ref "emacs-code-coloring-outdated" >}})
* [VHDL Emacs mode navigation using ctags are broken]({{< ref "vhdl-emacs-mode-navigation-using-ctags-are-broken" >}})
* [Room for Improvement]({{< ref "room-improvement" >}})

One of the most common comments I got was that Emacs is free. I know there is a bit of ambiguity in the word [free](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre), but I get the feeling that most people are worried about their money. They don't want to pay for an *editor*. It seems hard for people to compare a $840 tool, with [one](https://guest.iis.ee.ethz.ch/~zimmi/emacs/vhdl-mode.html) that comes at a flat $0.00. 

Tomorrow, we will launch the Sigasi 2.0 Starter Edition. The *Starter Edition* will be free. Not just for a week or for a beta period, but forever.
The Starter Edition is designed to be better than Emacs for any VHDL work you do. If your VHDL design is *small* enough, you even get access to *all of the nice features* that paying customers will have. Stay tuned for more info.
