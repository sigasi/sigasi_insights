> Too stupid or too stubborn?

A few weeks ago, one of my colleagues at Sigasi (a VI user himself)
stated that anybody who is not using Emacs for their VHDL work will
either be *too stubborn or too stupid* to switch to Sigasi. (Note: this
was a personal opinion and **not** the official company position). He
had been using VI ([gvim](http://www.vim.org) actually) for all of his
VHDL work years ago. As he learned more out about the great features of
the Emacs VHDL mode, he concluded that he himself had probably been too
stubborn to switch. Other text editors (VI, Notepad++, UltraEdit,
Crimson) may be highly configurable and versatile, but they are not
highly adapted to VHDL (or to any other language, for that matter).

The problem with the whole [editor wars thing](http://xkcd.com/378/) is
that no editor is really better than the next for simple tasks like
editing bash scripts or [INI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file)
files. Even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad_(software)">MS
Notepad</a> or [nano](http://www.nano-editor.org/) will do fine. For a
task that takes only three minutes, there is little to gain from a
better editor. But if you are engineering a complex system, you need
good tools.

I agree that (before Sigasi existed) anything else then Emacs for VHDL
was probably not the best choice. I don’t agree with the “too stupid or
too stubborn” part. Many people roll in to a particular editor and get
to know all nice features over the years. There is a relatively *large
cost to switching* because you have to use a new tool. Learning a new
editor is not so much an intellectual challenge as it a new habit. Most
Emacs users couldn’t tell you the keyboard shortcut for “fix sensitivity
list” even if their lives depended on it. Their [fingers know the
shortcuts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_memory). Learning a new
tool and new shortcuts takes practice. It requires the insight that
another tool is really better and the discipline to go through with the
transition.

I think that people working with inferior editors are neither stupid nor
stubborn. I think they just never got the right trigger to decide on
switching to a better editor. I also believe that engineers are smart
enough to consider **relevant** and **technical** arguments and to weigh
these arguments against the effort of switching (and against their
pride).

In my series of [Sigasi vs. Emacs comparisons](.) I
would like to leave it up to you for this week. Not because I don’t have
any time to write a new post, but because I want to know what *you*
think.

-   Why do you use Emacs for VHDL (or for any other language) and why is
    it so great?
-   Why do you love Notepad++, UltraEdit or JEdit?
-   Why do you use an IDE and why does that beat the King of traditional
    Unix editors?
-   What are your criteria for selecting your code entry / code
    comprehension tools?

Let me know in the comments section, below.
