I just uploaded my slides for my <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/summiteurope2009/">Eclipse Summit Europe</a> presentation <a href="https://www.eclipsecon.org/summiteurope2009/sessions24d6.html?id=990">"EDA Start-up story from the trenches"</a> to <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/sigasi/eda-startup-story-from-the-trenches">SlideShare</a>. For some reason adding the slides to my <a href="https://www.eclipsecon.org/summiteurope2009/sessions24d6.html?id=990">session page</a> did not work, I will try that again later.

I really look forward to a meet a lot of interesting people and see a lot of informative talks. I especially look forward to learn more about UI testing.

I was delighted to read that <a href="http://aniszczyk.org/2009/10/19/eclipse-summit-europe-2009/">over 30 people signed up for the morning runs</a>. Last year <a href="http://aniszczyk.org">Chris</a> and I were only two :-).

I just hope the <em>Deutsche Bahn</em> is more punctual than last year, so that I enjoy a smooth high speed train ride instead of a tiring journey with stopping trains and long, nightly taxi rides.

See you there,  
Hendrik.
