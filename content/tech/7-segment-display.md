A few weeks ago, a <a href="http://hes.elis.ugent.be/pbertels">friend of mine</a> talked about using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment_display">seven-segment display</a> in a VHDL lab in <a href="http://www.ugent.be">his university</a>.

Of course, he wanted his students to simulate before they synthesize. I thought it would be nice to have a module that can emulate a this a seven-segment display as ASCII-art.

I created this module in about an hour and after some more minor modifications, I decided to publish it for everybody to use.
