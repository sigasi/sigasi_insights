Dear customer, we have just released the 3.0 version of our product, and renamed it to “Sigasi Studio”. 

Except for the added features, **nothing changes for you**: Your **old license key is valid** for Sigasi Studio 3.0.

Floating license users: you need to **update your FlexLM server** to the latest version (while using the same license key). 

We have defined new editions for Sigasi Studio (**Creator**, **XL** and **XL Doc** instead of the old Pro, Premium and Premium Doc). 
The [feature matrix](http://www.sigasi.com/products) has changed a little bit, but your old license will unlock all of the 
features that you were able to use in Sigasi 2.x, plus the new Sigasi Studio 3 features.

The free Sigasi Studio **Starter** edition has now been optimized to work with minimal set-up.
Sigasi Studio Starter now works as a file editor, with the added power of navigation and code checking, rather than a project-based IDE.

## Updating

> Floating license users: **update your FlexLM license server daemon**!

For any questions, please contact your local distributor or contact Sigasi directly.
