Almost a year ago, we've posted an
[article]({{< ref "/tech/customize-documentation-sigasi-using-dom.md" >}}) on
**advanced customization** of the **documentation generated by Sigasi
Studio**. In the article, we've demonstrated the use of the [Document
Object Model](http://www.w3.org/DOM/) (DOM) and
[Python](https://www.python.org/) to alter the HTML code of the
generated documentation.  The article contains a fully elaborated
example, as well as some suggestions of other use cases that the DOM
could handle.

Lately, a customer challenged us to substantiate our claims about
those additional use cases. Well, we don't mind a small challenge, so
one Friday afternoon we switched our focus from VHDL and Verilog to
HTML and Python. In particular, the customer asked whether we could help with

* adding a company logo near the top of the file, and
* removing one or more sections from the documentation

And, **yes**, we can!

In fact, the following piece of code is all you need to add a logo,
and to remove the documentation of SystemVerilog `always` blocks.

```python
from htmldom import htmldom

# Parse the generated documentation
dom = htmldom.HtmlDom("file:documentation.html").createDom()

# Add a logo after the title. You can make the markup fancier if desired.
dom.find("h1.title").after('<img src="company_logo.png">')

# Remove the (System)Verilog "always" blocks from the documentation.
#
# "always" blocks in the documentation are surrounded by
# <div id="...always-blocks">
all_divs = dom.find("div")
for div in all_divs:
    if str(div.attr("id")).endswith("always-blocks"):
        div.remove()

# Save the altered documentation
with open('new_documentation.html', 'w') as f:
    f.write(dom.find("html").html())
```

After reading the generated documentation, the script first adds a
logo after the main title (`<h1 class=title>`).  Then, it looks up and
removed all `<div>` blocks of which the id ends with
`always-blocks`. Finally, the resulting document is saved as a new
file.

While this looks simple, it may not be obvious to come up with the
right htmldom API calls, or which elements to look for in the
generated documentation.  The **htmldom API** is [**documented**
here](http://thehtmldom.sourceforge.net/), but this documentation is
not very clear so you may need some additional online searching with
dr. Google and the like.  When it comes to finding elements in the
documentation, a first option that comes to mind is simply opening the
generated HTML in a text editor. While that will work, **web
browsers** often have a feature to **inspect HTML** which makes one's
life much easier, as shown below.  One *caveat* - note that the
structure of the generated documentation is not fixed like an API, so
it may happen that HTML tags change with a new version of Sigasi
Studio.
