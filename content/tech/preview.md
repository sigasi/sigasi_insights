For those users who want to get early access to the features and bugfixes of upcoming Sigasi Studio releases, we have set up an extra release channel, called "_Sigasi Preview_".

The Sigasi Preview release channel offers more frequent releases than the official releases. This page gives an introduction to the most important changes.

Although these preview releases are less rigorously tested than the official releases, they are stable enough for daily use.

This release adds **VHDL 2019 tool directives**, **signed Windows binaries** for better interaction with Windows SmartScreen, and a [**new and improved regex engine**](https://github.com/google/re2j).
As always, there are many other improvements that enhance speed and usability to give you a better experience.

**If you run into any problems, [please let us know](https://www.sigasi.com/support/)**.

# Current preview release

## VHDL 2019 tool directives

VHDL 2019 improves many aspects of the popular hardware design language.
One of the new anticipated features it brings is tool directives - a simplified version of preprocessor found in SystemVerilog or C family of languages.

It allows to conditionally enable code based on tool type, debug mode, or really any other custom variable.  
Sigasi brings full syntax, autocomplete, hover,... support for this new feature.

You can edit the defined tool directives by right-clicking your project and then going to `Properties > VHDL Conditional Variables`.

## Signed Windows binaries

Signing binaries adds irrefutable proof that binary was published by a said third party.

We've been signing our jar files for as long as Sigasi Studio has existed, and recently we've also added signing on Mac.  
However, we didn't sign our Windows binary yet, which causes Windows SmartScreen to show a warning when you try to execute Sigasi for the first time.

Starting with the 4.16 release, our jar files, Mac and Windows binaries will all be signed adding irrefutable proof that our binaries were produced by Sigasi. This will then, in time, also make sure that Eclipse, Mac and Windows will allow you to run the binaries without any scary warnings.

{{< figure src="/img/releasenotes/4.16/SignedWindowsBinaries.png" link="/img/releasenotes/4.16/SignedWindowsBinaries.png" title="Sigasi Studio now has signed Windows binaries">}}

## New and improved regex engine

Regular expressions are used in many parts of Sigasi Studio but the most visible feature using it is the [Naming Conventions]({{< ref "manual/rules/naming-conventions.md" >}}) as users can fill in their own expressions to be used in a validations. Next to writing syntax errors however, regex' can also easily incur a large, exponential performance hit. A small change to a regex can cause a high amount of backtracking skyrocketing its execution time.

Luckily, there are smarter engines - such as [RE2/J](https://github.com/google/re2j) - that do not have such an exponential cost and instead scale linearly. To make sure our users never suffer from these unfortunate regex' we've adopted RE2/J.

Do note that if you use a regex that is supported by the Java regex engine, but not by RE2/J, you will now get an extra warning directing you to the naming conventions.

## Deprecated Graphics Configuration

Sigasi can automatically generate a [Block Diagram]({{< ref "manual/views.md#block-diagram-view" >}}) and a [State Machine]({{< ref "manual/views.md#state-machine-view" >}}) out of your code. However, these autogenerated diagrams might become quite complicated and hide the essence of the design. Sometimes users also just want to create custom visualizations or simplifications.

For this reason, Sigasi has a custom DSL (called the [Graphics Configuration]({{< ref "manual/graphics.md" >}})) that allows you to filter, color, highlight, group,... parts of you design in these diagrams. However, a custom DSL, even with good a good editor, is quite a cumbersome way to solve this issue. Sigasi will be deprecating this cumbersome solution and will present a more user-friendly approach in a future release. If you feel like this feature is vital to you **[please let us know](https://www.sigasi.com/support/)**.

## New and Noteworthy Changes

* We've reformatted our license files to improve readability, the actual content was **not** changed
* We've made our tutorial more consistent, making sure they use correct wording, hotkeys and directions towards other screens
* Sigasi on linux now shows missing dependencies for Chromium in an error dialog at startup. Mac and Windows have no need for such a dialog as they always have all the necessary dependencies available
* Improved the consistency of our tutorial projects
* All mentions to the Creator license have been removed
* The automatic autocomplete after typing `.` or `` ` `` can now be disabled in `Preferences > VHDL` or `Preferences > Verilog/SystemVerilog`  
  {{< figure src="/img/releasenotes/4.16/AutocompleteAfterDot.png" link="/img/releasenotes/4.16/AutocompleteAfterDot.png" title="Toggle automatic autocomplete after character">}}
* Formatting has been enabled for files that use keywords of a higher language version
* **Ctrl + hover** has been enabled for the last character of identifiers
* Improved resilience to changes in the project for the [Find References View]({{< ref "manual/editor.md#find-references" >}})
* Improved responsiveness for the Find References View
* Removed the <span uk-icon="question"></span> button from views in which they were redundant
* Removed outdated documentation from Eclipse's internal documentation pages
* Navigating from the [Outline View]({{< ref "manual/views.md#outline-view" >}}) or the [Hierarchy View]({{< ref "manual/views.md#hierarchy-view" >}}) to the editor now selects more relevant constructs
* A warning is now issued on the `.library_mapping.xml` when it references non-existent files. A Quick Fix to remove the offending mapping has been also been added.
* Errors reported by external toolchains that do not contain a location are now propagated to Sigasi Studio as errors on the project  
  {{< figure src="/img/releasenotes/4.16/LocationlessErrors.png" link="/img/releasenotes/4.16/LocationlessErrors.png" title="Toolchain's errors without location are linked to project">}}
* The [Documentation View]({{< ref "manual/views.md#documentation-view" >}}) now reacts better to all kinds of changes to the project, assuring it never misses a refresh

* Colors changed through `Preferences > Sigasi > VHDL or Verilog/SystemVerilog> Syntax Coloring` are now immediately applied
* The [State Machine View]({{< ref "manual/views.md#state-machine-view" >}}) icon to show edge labels (![show labels icon](/img/releasenotes/4.16/font.png)) has been replaced by an icon to hide comments (![hide comments icon](/img/releasenotes/4.16/hide_comments.png)) and an icon to hide the conditions (![hide conditions icon](/img/releasenotes/4.16/hide_conditions.png)). The [Graphics Configuration]({{< ref "manual/graphics.md" >}}) now also offers the ability to show only comments or conditions separately through `labels comment` or `labels condition`.
* All of our tree views (Hierarchy View, [Open Design Unit]({{< ref "manual/views.md#open-design-unit-view" >}}), Export diagrams, ...) now use consistent capitalization and coloring
* It's now possible to select the project for which to configure VUnit in the [Add VUnit support]({{< ref "manual/vunit.md#add-vunit-support-to-an-existing-sigasi-project" >}}) dialog
  {{< figure src="/img/releasenotes/4.16/AddVUnitSupport.png" link="/img/releasenotes/4.16/AddVUnitSupport.png" title="Add VUnit Support wizard with project selection">}}

    {{< figure src="/img/releasenotes/4.16/SpaceInPreprocessorDirective.png" link="/img/releasenotes/4.16/SpaceInPreprocessorDirective.png" title="Space after backtick of preprocessing directive">}}

## Updates

* Eclipse has been updated to 2022-03
