The sources of the Sigasi Insights portal are hosted on Github. So if you find a typo or an error, you can fix this yourself. GitHub also makes it easy to make bigger contributes such as a guest blog.

Small fixes can be made on the website of GitHub, without installing extra tools.  
For bigger changes, it is better to build the website on your own machine first, and creating a *pull request* later.

## Fixing a typo, directly on GitHub {: #github}

* Log in into [GitHub](https://github.com)
* [Fork the Sigasi Insights repository](https://github.com/sigasi/sigasi_insights#fork-destination-box)
* Browse to the file you want to edit and click the edit button
  ![](images/insights_github_edit.png)
* At the bottom of the screen:
    * Add a commit message
    * Select the *"Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request" option*.
    * Click the **Commit Changes** button.
      ![](images/insights_github_patch.png)
* Next add a message to your pull request and click **Create pull request**

  By sending a pull request, you give all rights of your change to Sigasi ([Copyright info][/LICENSE])

## Bigger changes: clone Insights and preview your changes offline.

### Install Python and Urubu
Sigasi uses [Urubu][/opinion/urubu] as CMS system for the Insights website. Urubu is built with Python, So you need to have Python installed first.
Next, Urubu can be installed with pip:

```
pip install urubu
```
If pip is not yet available on your system, follow the [pip installation instructions](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html).


### Clone the sources and create Pull Request

* Clone the Insights repository, as explained in [#github]. 
* Add your content (e.g. a guest blog in the `/opinion/` folder). ([Authoring information](https://github.com/sigasi/sigasi_insights/blob/master/README.markdown))  
  Your MarkDown file must have following header:
