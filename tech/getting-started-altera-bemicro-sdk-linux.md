*I recently got an FPGA-on-a-USB-stick as a Christmas present: an [Altera/Arrow BeMicro SDK](http://www.altera.com/b/bemicro-sdk.html"). Fun to play with and ideal to refresh my hardware design skills... I thought... Immediately I was confronted again with how much work it is to set up all necessary hardware design tools.*

The system requirements states that you need Windows, but fortunately I got it working on Linux (Fedora release 13 (Goddard)). Installing Altera Quartus and Nios II went flawlessly. Finding out how to get JTAG with the USB blaster to work was a bit harder.

# Install Altera tools

The Altera Quartus 10.1 installation was slow because of the huge 6GB download but it finished without issues; no [special tricks](http://fpga4u.epfl.ch/wiki/Install_Quartus_II) that were required for earlier versions.

If your Linux machine has SE Linux enabled, run:
```bash
sudo chcon -t textrel_shlib_t /opt/altera/10.1/quartus/linux/*.so
```

# USB-Blaster setup

Setting the USB-blaster was a bit harder:
As described [here](http://www.altera.com/download/drivers/dri-usb_b-lnx.html) you need to create an extra udev rule (`sudo vim /etc/udev/rules.d/51-usbblaster.rules`) with following content:
```bash
# USB-Blaster
BUS=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="09fb", SYSFS{idProduct}=="6001", MODE="0666", PROGRAM="/bin/sh -c 'K=%k; K=$${K#usbdev}; printf /proc/bus/usb/%%03i/%%03i$${K%%%%.*} $${K#*.}'", RUN+="/bin/chmod 0666 %c"
```
You can load this new rule by running `sudo udevadm control --reload-rules`

# JTAG daemon configuration

Based on the description on <http://alterawiki.com/wiki/Quartus_for_Linux>, I created two
configuration files:
```bash
sudo mkdir /etc/jtagd
sudo cp /opt/altera/10.1/quartus/linux/pgm_parts.txt
/etc/jtagd/jtagd.pgm_parts
touch ~/.jtag.conf
```

Next, I appended following lines to my to my `/etc/rc.local` file:
```bash
echo 356 40000 32 32000 > /proc/sys/kernel/sem
/opt/altera/10.1/quartus/bin/jtagd
```

And I started the jtagd daemon by running rc.local:

```bash
sudo /etc/rc.local
```

# Check
You can easily verify that Everything is working with following procedure:

<ul>
<li> Plug in your BeMicro SDK stick
<li> Start Quartus II
<li> Select Tools > Programmer
<li> Click the “Hardware Setup...” button, double click on “USB-Blaster” and click close
<li> If you now press the “Autodetect” button, two devices should be visible: EP3C25 and EP4CE22 (this is the Altera Cyclone 4 FPGA). If you see those it means that everything is OK.
</ul>
